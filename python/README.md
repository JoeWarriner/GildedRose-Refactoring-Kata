## Refactoring Kata

This is a refactoring exercise I did, with feedback from my mentor Michal Poreba.
The idea was to substantially improve the example code, while implementing "micro-commits" (i.e. very small, regular commits)

I made three attempts at the exercise (shown in branches branch_1, branch_2, branch_3).
